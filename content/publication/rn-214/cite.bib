It was studied using high-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The compound crystallizes in the cubic MgCu<sub>2</sub> structure type. Its successful synthesis further proves that high-pressure high-temperature conditions can be used to obtain alloys holding a Laves phase structure. Ab initio calculations were done to predict the mechanical properties of the material. We also discuss the usage of extreme conditions to synthesize and study materials present in the nuclear waste.},
