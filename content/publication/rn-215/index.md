abstract: 'The novel structure of lanthanum hydroxyborate La<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>
  was synthesized by the reaction of partially hydrolyzed lanthanum and boron oxide
  in a diamond anvil cell under high-pressure/high-temperature (HPHT) conditions of
  30 GPa and ∼2,400 K. The single-crystal X-ray structure determination of the lanthanum
  hydroxyborate revealed: <mml:math id=\"m1\" xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mover

  a = 6.555(2) Å, c = 17.485(8) Å, Z = 6, R<sub>1</sub> = 0.056. The three-dimensional
  structure consists of discrete planar BO<sub>3</sub> groups and three crystallographically
  different La ions: one is surrounded by 9, one by 10, and one by 12 oxygen anions.
  The band gap was estimated using ab initio calculations to be 4.64 eV at ambient
  pressure and 5.26 eV at 30 GPa. The current work describes the novel HPHT lanthanum
  hydroxyborate with potential application as a deep-ultraviolet birefringent material.'
