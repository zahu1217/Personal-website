It was studied using high-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The compound crystallizes in the cubic MgCu<sub>2</sub> structure type. Its successful synthesis further proves that high-pressure high-temperature conditions can be used to obtain alloys holding a Laves phase structure. Ab initio calculations were done to predict the mechanical properties of the material. We also discuss the usage of extreme conditions to synthesize and study materials present in the nuclear waste.},

   title = {The synthesis of novel lanthanum hydroxyborate at extreme conditions},
   journal = {Frontiers in Chemistry},
   volume = {11},
   abstract = {The novel structure of lanthanum hydroxyborate La<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> was synthesized by the reaction of partially hydrolyzed lanthanum and boron oxide in a diamond anvil cell under high-pressure/high-temperature (HPHT) conditions of 30 GPa and ∼2,400 K. The single-crystal X-ray structure determination of the lanthanum hydroxyborate revealed: <mml:math id="m1" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>, a = 6.555(2) Å, c = 17.485(8) Å, Z = 6, R<sub>1</sub> = 0.056. The three-dimensional structure consists of discrete planar BO<sub>3</sub> groups and three crystallographically different La ions: one is surrounded by 9, one by 10, and one by 12 oxygen anions. The band gap was estimated using ab initio calculations to be 4.64 eV at ambient pressure and 5.26 eV at 30 GPa. The current work describes the novel HPHT lanthanum hydroxyborate with potential application as a deep-ultraviolet birefringent material.},
